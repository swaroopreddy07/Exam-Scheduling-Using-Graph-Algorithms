# Exam-Scheduling-Using-Graph-Algorithms
This project implements an Exam Scheduling System using graph-based models and graph coloring algorithms. A conflict graph is built where nodes represent subjects, and edges indicate shared students. Scheduling is optimized using Backtracking, Greedy, DSATUR, Smallest Degree Last, and Tabu Search to minimize conflicts efficiently.
